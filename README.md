# GITHUB THEATER

Welcome to Github Theater this is a super cool terminal project which can be used to see a github repo in the form of a full movie!! 
Starting with the theater intro then the cast of the movie (contributors) then the monsters in the movie ( issues ) and then the main movie which has many scenes (commits) and then in the end just a end screen

## How to use it?
### Web interface ( supported by ttyd )
Well just open [theater](https://theater.anirudh.hackclub.app) and enter the username and repo name and you are good to enter the theater!!!!

### The binary way ( exe )
just open the exe from the github releases and enter the username and repo name and you are good to enter the theater!!!!

## What does it uses???
I mean its just PYTHON!! :shrug: 
Hope you enjoyed it!!
